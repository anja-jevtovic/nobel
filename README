main.py -> DAV #1 main code
dash-app.py -> DAV #1 data visual generator
geo-map-prototype.py -> DAV #2 prototype
geo-map.py -> DAV #2 example 1
geo-map-example.py -> DAV #2 example 2

Concept Outline:

Class #1
  * DAV #1 concepts quick recap
  * Json - what is it?
  * GeoJson
      * What is it?
      * How it functions?
      * How to create one?
  * Practice time:
      * Looking for data - data set should have â†’ location (must be country) and some numbers at least
      * Generating GeoJson
      
Class #2
  * How to use it in Python/Plotly?
  * Practice time: Generate data visual by using Plotly only (20-30 lines of code)
  
Class #3
  * Practice time: Generate complete Dash/Plotly application
  
Enrichment Opportunity: Generate geo map for regions of one country or one part of the world

LMS: Katacoda for learning code

The available scopes in Dash/Plotly are: 'world', 'usa', 'europe', 'asia', 'africa', 'north america', 'south america'
